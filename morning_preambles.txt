I don't know about you, but I'm feeling
I need to tell you something. I'm feeling
It's {hour} o'clock, and I'm feeling
Just so you know: I'm feeling
This morning, I'm feeling
Today, I'm feeling
Your {hour}:00 update: I'm feeling
Wow... I'm really feeling
I woke up this morning feeling
My alarm went off early this morning, and my first thought was that I'm feeling
Jumped out of bed today thinking that I'm feeling
Goodness. This morning I'm feeling
This is one of those mornings where I just feel
Sat up in bed this morning, biting my lip, feeling
Good morning! I'm feeling
